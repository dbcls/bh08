=== Open Space (evening session) ===

In the evening session, as we have relatively large number of  participants,
I'd like to use Open Space method for discussing in sub groups.

So, after lunch, we will discuss to select several topics proposed  by participants,
and all of you will join one of the topic specific groups.
