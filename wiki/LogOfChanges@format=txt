Bioperl-live SVN version numbers precede the time and description.

== EMBL ==

* 14514 (2008-02-19 01:57:11 -0500): Reindenting the code. Too many lines were slightly off making reading difficult. No code changes.

* 14543 (2008-02-25 03:22:15 -0500): better roundtip when preventing line wrapping between author surname and initials

* 14544 (2008-02-25 04:46:26 -0500) RC (reference comment) line was printed in wrong place. It belongs right after RN line.


== Swiss ==

* 14509 (2008-02-17 04:48:07 -0500): removed extra space chars and a full stop at the end of the Â FT HELIX and STRAND lines. No more extra spaces at the end of the line. The line length in this format is 76, not 80. Changing that solved a lot of line differences

* 14510 (2008-02-17 05:00:50 -0500): GN line output now follows the new format. BioPerl would need new objects to store all information so for now only the official name (Name=) and synonym categories are kept. ORFNames and OrderedLocusNames are treated as synonyms.

* 14511 (2008-02-17 06:29:31 -0500): prevent line wrapping within author name (RA lines) and withing key frase (KW lines), but allow wrapping at hyphen in a title (RT lines) 

* 14512 (2008-02-17 06:36:20 -0500): DOI can include semi colon (;) character. Allow that.

* 14515 (2008-02-19 03:17:19 -0500): Reindenting the code. Too many lines were slightly off making reading difficult. No code changes.

* 14516 (2008-02-19 03:51:36 -0500):  FTId is no longer treated a part of the description of an FT key but similarly to EMBL FT qualifiers. This allows for 100% roundtrip of the Feature Table.

* 14534 (2008-02-22 03:09:01 -0500): Do not print out empty KW (keyword) lines.

* 14538 (2008-02-23 09:48:23 -0500): GN (Gene Name) line parsing rewrite. Breaks backward compatibility. Can now deal with >1 gene per entry and four categories of names per gene. Parses old style syntax (...OR ... OR ... ) into one gene name and synonyms for each gene. Tests included. Docs to follow.

* 14539 (2008-02-23 10:10:46 -0500): AC (accession) line now wraps if there are too many accessions to fit one line

* 14541 (2008-02-25 01:10:48 -0500): documentation for the GN line parsing and management
