= !BioPerl Outstanding Issues in roundtripping =

At bioperl-live SVN revision 14544.

All known issues below are classified as minor.

== fasta ==

* possible minor issue: !BioPerl does not parse in  sequence version nor fasta from genbank with a gi number. BioRuby does that. Should we?

== genbank ==

* FT qualifier lines are not returned in order

== embl ==

 * minor: only the actual date on the DT (date) line is kept, release information and document version is lost.
   * '''Note:''' We now track only the sequence version from the ID line, not the document version from the second DT line.
   * '''Note:''' BioSQL can store both versions. Should we update the !BioPerl Bio::Seq::RichSeqI API to have document version, too?
{{{
DT   27-FEB-1998 (Rel. 54, Created)
DT   14-NOV-2006 (Rel. 89, Last updated, Version 6)
->
DT   27-FEB-1998
DT   14-NOV-2006
}}}
 * minor: Word wrapping differences if free text lines, especially in author lists
   **  Line 'RL   Submitted (date) to the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ databases.' is shorter then 80, so the affiliation from the following line gets wrapped into this line.
 * minor: the feature key/value pairs (FT) are not returned in order
