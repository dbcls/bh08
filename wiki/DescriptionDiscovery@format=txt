== What metadata is required to adequately describe a service? ==

 * author contact
 * authority identification
 * service version
 * software title
    * nature of algorithm (likely = myGrid Task ontology)
 * software version
 * bandwidth and/or # requests per minute
 * example input
 * example output and/or REGEXP to test output
 * some description of error-handling capacity
 * sync/async
 * nature of underlying data
   * organism
   * biological nature of data
     * DNA/RNA/Protein
     * SAGE
     * Microarray
        * platform, etc.
 * input parameters and purpose of each
 * output parameters and purpose of each
 * usage/license restrictions
 * authentication (is needed or not?)
 * usage statistics (as per service provider)
 * usage statistics (as per third party commentary)
 * protocol (moby, soap, GET, POST, etc.)
 * mirrors?


== What ontologies exist that could provide this metadata? ==

 * [http://www.mygrid.org.uk/mygrid-moby-service/ myGrid Ontology] - provides many of the annotation information elements we claim to need.  e.g. Model Organism Databases; types/formats of flatfile records
 * myGrid ontology also provides an ontology for bioinformatics tasks
 * Moby Object - an ontology of data-types
 * Moby Service - similar to myGrid's bioinformatics_task branch of the myGrid Ontology

== Do we need additional ontologies?  Who should make them? ==

 * TBD

== What would a service discovery request look like? ==

 * TBD

== W3C HCLSWG has some recommendations ==

 * these are largely URL-based + various HTTP protocol redirects etc for discovery of metadata

== Life Sciences Identifiers ==

 * LSIDs have formal spec for retrieval of both data and metadata
   * LSIDs do not support "REST" access

== DOI or other redirect ==

 * ???

== [http://bio2rdf.org Bio2RDF] project & Banff Manifesto ==

 * proposed URI format:  bm:namespace:id 
   * for example bm:pdb:122345
 * Freebase database of data providers and their namespaces
   * Freebase is editable by end-users
   * could be automated v.v. lookup
 * Somehow map bm:pdb:122345  to its equivalent URL
 * can we convince NAR to do this, since it has a list of all databases?
