   * Unused services should be disabled ... Done
 * open-bio.org
   * mailing list (already available)
   * preparation of MediaWiki by OBF server administrators ... Done
   * moving contents from wiki.bioruby.org to bioruby.open-bio.org/wiki/ ... in progress
   * (future work) migration from CVS to SVN
 * bioruby.org
   * moving wiki to bioruby.open-bio.org/Wiki
   * moving RDoc to bioruby.rubyforge.org ... Done
   * moving toppage to Wiki ... in progress
   * (future work) tar.gz should move to ???
   * (future work) www.bioruby.org and bioruby.org should point bioruby.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page (redirection?)

== !BioMoby client in Ruby ==

 * ~~[wiki:MOBYRubyClient]~~ now working!

== BioSQL on BioRuby ==

 * rewritten by using !ActiveRecord

== Bio::Sequence improvements for round trip ==

=== Input (creation of Bio::Sequence object) ===
   * Bio::Sequence#read(str ~~or file?~~~) ... Done
     * (or Bio::Sequence#input(str or file?) ???)
     * Bio::*#to_biosequence is automatically called ... Done
   * Bio::*#to_biosequence implementation
     * Bio::EMBL ... Done (jan)
     * Bio::GenBank ... Done (ngoto)

=== Output (formatting) ===
   * Bio::Sequence#output(format = ''anything'')
     * using ERB templates
       * Bio::Sequence#output(format = :embl) ... in progress (jan)
       * Bio::Sequence#output(format = :genbank) ... in progress (ngoto)

=== Easy access to Bio::Sequence inside BioRuby ===
   * (idea only) Bio::Sequence#embl, Bio::Sequence#gb
     * (idea only) can access as if it is Bio::EMBL or Bio::GenBank objects
     * (idea only) delegates to Bio::Sequence objects (or translation/conversion may be needed)
     * (idea only) Bio::EMBL (and GenBank etc.) changed to Bio::Sequence delegation objects?
       * jan's idea: BiorubyFormats
       * problem with lazy evaluation?

=== Internal structure of Bio::Sequence ===
   * (future work?) generated from / compatible with XML Schema

== NEXML parser in BioRuby ==
   * (future work) generate parser code from XML schema

== Which XML library is better in Ruby for BioRuby? ==
   * REXML
   * xmlparser
   * ...
