          <h1 id="ObjectivesfortheWebServiceHackathon">Objectives for the Web Service Hackathon</h1>
<h2 id="Background">Background</h2>
<p>
Databases in lifescience area have enormous amount of data, still
growing and becoming more multi-faceted. To provide integrated services
, the way just centralising these databases, like by mirroring each
databases, is insufficient but also the way using directly over
distributed environments is strongly needed to be constructed at really
serviceable state.
</p>
<p>
This situation brought on SOAP/WSDL web services to be launched at
institutes around bioinformatics like NCBI and EBI abroad, and DDBJ XML,
KEGG API, PDBj, CBRI in Japan, providing respective services handling
many tools and databases.
</p>
<p>
Also, by myGrid project and BioMOBY project, efforts has already been
made to provide foundation to use those web services in an unified way,
which brings situation very practical to implement integration by web services
technology around this field.
</p>
<p>
Main problems are, the variety of each specification and
naming convention, and unstandardised data structure to be passed.
Additionally, handling for cases like temporal service down or whatever error
occured while executing a job just rely on each provided servers which 
tends to leave insufficient specification documentation.
</p>
<p>
Existence of different usages among each services, or situation compelling
user to exchange data types and to handle exceptions for their own
is really inefficient. Furthermore, the number of serviced tools and
databases providing web services are still few, which makes it quite
severe to achieve constructions of workflows through these services for
the moment.
</p>
<h2 id="EffortsinDBCLS">Efforts in DBCLS</h2>
<p>
Thus we at DBCLS have planned to search usage of existing web services and
of those data structures to construct proxy-like server, which aim to provide
unifed and consistent naming conventions and usages. 
To make this, we would first consider;
</p>
<ul><li>Services be well documented.
</li><li>Owe error handling at server side as much as possible.
</li><li>Servers to be accessible by languages widely used like Perl, Ruby, Python,
Java and more as many as possible.
</li><li>Owe data exchange by server side to make communicate between many
servers servicing web services.
</li><li>Pipelines over several steps be done on server side to be effective enough.
</li></ul><p>
By conducting our proposal, not just providing environments exeeded in
usability to many researchers, it can act as an infrastructure for
constructing workflows which accordingly provide each centers a dramatical
increase of internet access counts.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, consideration is  needed over what categories of
services to provide, those quantity and quality. Therefore it is
desirable to parallelize working on providing service along with 
developments of integrated databases and tools at DBCLS.
</p>
<h2 id="ObjectivesofthisHackathon">Objectives of this Hackathon</h2>
<p>
To lead to a standardisation of;
</p>
<ul><li>naming convention of methods
</li><li>data structure passed among services
</li><li>job controlling
</li></ul><p>
which at present differ within each providers.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, we are going to held developer's meeting in January or
February of 2008. There, core developers and key members at home and
abroad related to each web service providers, including BioMOBY, 
Open Bio*s (ie. like <a class="missing wiki">BioPerl?</a>), would be offered to attend 
this meeting, staying for about a week in Japan.
</p>
<p>
So far, data type (class design) for bioinformatics has been defined for
each project of Open-bio (like <a class="missing wiki">BioPerl?</a>, <a class="missing wiki">BioPython?</a>, <a class="missing wiki">BioJava?</a>, <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/BioRuby">BioRuby</a>)
respectively.
Though to benefit interoperability, it seems to be nice to define
standard specification of objects based on web services' class, to 
comply with it.
