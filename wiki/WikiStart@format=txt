Towards integrated web service in life science with Open Bio* libraries.

[[PageOutline(1-3)]]

== Summary ==

The number of web service providers in the field of bioinformatics is increasing every year.
In theory, these services are interoperable and independent of specific computer languages.
However, each service uses its own definition of data types and
method naming conventions.
Moreover, these services are often not usable by specific languages
(partly, due to the lack of compliance of the SOAP/WSDL specification in the language's library).

This lack of interoperability prevents these services from becoming
popular among end users and developers alike and they are under
utilised as an infrastructure of their daily research.

The [http://www.biomoby.org/ BioMOBY] project has tried to overcome these problems by defining ontologies for data types and methods used in the services.
However, there are many major service providers which are not yet participating in the BioMOBY framework.
For example, there are several web service providers in Japan such as [http://www.xml.nig.ac.jp/ DDBJ], [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/soap/ KEGG],
[http://www.pdbj.org/ PDBj] and [http://www.cbrc.jp/ CBRC] but none of these are integrated in any way.

For this reason, at [http://www.dbcls.jp/en/ DBCLS], we started to
develop a new proxy server which translates user requests for the
appropriate web service providers.  If all [http://www.open-bio.org/
Open Bio*] libraries were to support BioMOBY and other service providers,
interoperability among these services are significantly improved.
To achieve this we need agreement about the future direction of web services by
every web service provider and by client developers.

We believe that getting all web service providers together, to discuss the
standardization of objects and methods among web services, with Open
Bio* library developers from different programming languages
([http://www.bioperl.org/ BioPerl], [http://www.biopython.org/ BioPython], [http://www.bioruby.org/ BioRuby], and
[http://www.biojava.org/ BioJava]) will benefit usability and
interoperability of services for the life sciences in the next era.

For this purpose, we organize a !BioHackathon focusing on web services from four different domains.

 * Web service providers
  * Encourage independent service providers to join the movement of integration and interoperability
   * Increase the number of SOAP compliant services (tools/databases)
 * Open Bio* developers
  * Utilize every bioinformatics web service by 4 major computer languages (Perl, Python, Ruby, Java)
   * Create compatible classes for sequences, expressions, pathways etc. among Open Bio* libraries
 * Workflow client developers
  * Provide various clients to create and execute bioinformatics workflows
   * Connect seamlessly: Web service - Grid, Remote - Local, SOAP/WSDL - REST, Sync - [wiki:AsyncGroup Async]
 * BioMOBY project developers
  * Standardize the objects and methods in bioinformatics web services via BioMOBY
   * Discuss the best solution of the framework and the ontologies for the life sciences
